            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hello there! I am Leon and I am a Year 4 Business and Computing(BCG) student at NTU! I first developed 
                an interest in programming in computing class during secondary school. I was really enjoyed the 
                problem solving nature of programming, and was fascinated by how I could create something complex 
                from simple building blocks. Over the past 3 years, I have built a strong foundation in computer 
                science principles, and picked up various different skills through internships, hackathons and 
                various personal projects. Currently, I am specialising in Artificial Inteligence and Data Analytics.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy gaming, playing a variety of games, from building games like 
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/">Factorio</a> to FPS games like 
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/">CS:GO</a>. When time and 
                finances permit, I enjoy travelling as well!</p>
            <p>This is a portfolio page built during the course of the Google Software Product Sprint program!</p>
            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>Below are some of the projects that I have worked on!</p>

                    <h5>REDACTED - Autonomous Maze Explorer</h5>
                    <p>REDACTED is a robotic system capable of autonomously exploring and traversing an unknown maze. 
                        The robot is able to find the position of all obstacles, determine the fastest path from START to END, 
                        as well as perform image recognition of signs in the maze. In addition, the robot can be controlled 
                        wirelessly through an Android app.</p>
